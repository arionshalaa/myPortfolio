                <p>I'm an IT enthusiast and currently in my senior year of studying Computer Science at the
                    University of Business Technology in Kosovo
                    My expertise spans a wide array of programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript,
                    and Angular. My expertise extends to TypeScript, .NET, SQL, and MSSQL, enabling the
                    creation of seamless web experiences. Proficient in Azure and Git, I leverage these tools
                    to develop efficient, cloud-powered applications. My aptitude for optimizing database
                    performance ensures streamlined functionality. With an active presence on Stack
                    Overflow, I contribute technical support and insights to the community. Beyond coding, I
                    prioritize collaborative teamwork and effective communication. I take pride in crafting
                    well-structured code that transforms projects into harmonious digital achievements.
